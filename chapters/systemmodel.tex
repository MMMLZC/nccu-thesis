% async. network assumption
We assume the network condition of our system is under the asynchronous assumption, 
which means there exist a bounded network delay $d_a$ that won't be known before the algorithm start to execute. \par

% byzantine failure model

% cryptographic techniques

% adversaries' abilities
%1. can coordinate with the other faulty nodes in the system
%2. can delay the message but not indefinitely
%3. can send any kind of message they want but all normal node would only accept the one in the predefined format
%3. can't subvert the cryptographic techniques
